"""FASTA export, held as close to the desktop viewer as headlessness allows.

This is the main program's ``commands/export.py`` with exactly two changes, and
it is kept diffable against that file on purpose: the previous VR copy had
drifted into a different command entirely, accepting ``group:NAME`` targets
that upstream rejects by name while rejecting the ``#LABEL#`` targets upstream
documents.

1. ``desktop.Desktop_App.open_in_file_manager`` is not imported. It reaches
   PySide6, which is what stops the upstream module loading here, and the call
   it served - popping a file manager window once the files are written - has
   nowhere to appear in a headset session. The destination is printed instead.

2. Nothing else. ``import EMAPSSN_Config as cfg`` is left exactly as upstream
   writes it: ``_bootstrap_vr`` registers the Qt-free ``Settings_VR`` under that
   name, so it resolves to the VR settings here and to the real config on the
   desktop, and the sequence set, directory layout and every message stay
   byte-identical between the two front ends.

The sequences come from ``viewer.sequences_map``, which ``HeadlessViewer``
populates from the same FASTA parse it already performs for ``Length``
metadata - the same in-memory set upstream exports from, rather than a re-read
of the file that could disagree with what the viewer is showing.

    FASTA Export Tool
    =================
    Usage: export [clusters | groups | #LABEL# ...]
           export help

    Description:
      Extracts sanitized sequence subsets from the currently active viewer state and
      saves them as standalone .fasta files. Files are automatically routed to strictly
      organized subdirectories beneath the configured Analysis Results directory.
      
    [TARGET] Arguments (Default: clusters):
      clusters : Exports sequences based on their assigned topology cluster ID. 
                 (Note: Unclustered 'Noise' nodes are automatically ignored).
      groups / group : Exports separate .fasta files for ALL custom group labels currently defined.
      #LABEL# : Exports a specific custom group, topology cluster, or noise label.
                Multiple labels may be mixed and repeated labels are deduplicated.

    Examples:
      export             (Defaults to exporting all clusters)
      export group       (Exports all custom groups)
      export #human# (Exports only the sequences in the 'human' group)
      export #cluster_1# #noise# (Exports one cluster and the explicit noise subset)
